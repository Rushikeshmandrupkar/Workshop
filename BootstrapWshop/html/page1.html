      <h2>Fruits</h2>
      Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have 
      long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group 
      and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, 
      fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate)
      have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.

          All fruits benefit from proper post harvest care, and in many fruits, the plant hormone ethylene causes ripening. Therefore,
           maintaining most fruits in an efficient cold chain is optimal for post harvest storage, with the aim of extending and ensuring shelf life
